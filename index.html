                A magazine is a periodical publication, generally published on a regular 
                schedule(often weekly or monthly), containing a variety of content.
                They are generally <em>financed</em> by advertising, purchase price, 
                prepaid subscriptions,or by a combination of the three.

                In the technical sense a journal has continuous pagination throughout a volume. 
                Thus, Bloomberg Businessweek, which starts each issue anew with page one, is a magazine,
                but the Journal of Business Communication, which continues the same sequence of pagination throughout 
                the coterminous year, is a journal.

            <h3>What is RIP?</h3>
            <p>
                RIP stands for <strong>R</strong>est<strong>I</strong>n <strong>P</strong>eace. 
                Some professional or trade publications are also peer-reviewed, for example the Journal of Accountancy. 
                Non-peer-reviewed academic or professional publications are generally professional magazines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word "magazine" derives from Arabic makhazin )مخازن the broken plural of makhzan مخزن( meaning "depot,
                storehouse" (originally military storehouse); that comes to English via Middle French magasin and Italian magazzino. 
                In its original sense, the word "magazine" referred to a storage space or device. In the case of written publication,
                it refers to a collection of written articles.
            </p>
